# 🔢 Swipe Calculator App

Welcome to my **Swipe Calculator App** – a clean, responsive, and gesture-enabled calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s not just a basic calculator – it’s made to feel smooth, modern, and practical for daily use on both mobile and desktop.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Honestly, every student starts with a calculator – but I wanted to go **beyond just + - × ÷ .  
So I built a calculator that:
- **Works beautifully on mobile**
- Supports **swipe gestures**
- Has **scientific functions**
- Looks sleek and **feels modern**

This project helped me understand core JS logic, event handling, DOM manipulation,responsive design implementaion and most importantly — how to turn boring math into something fun to interact with.
